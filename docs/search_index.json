We will consider a possibly entangled system of two electrons. Electron spins can only be measured to be up or down (see Stern-Gerlach experiment). (For a more popular science-related example, consider a system of two Schr√∂dingers cat set-ups. Here, the system is entangled if observing the state of one cat affects the state of the other cat. Its not that they will definitely both be the same state, or opposite states, but just that the likelihood of the second cat will shift if you observe the first cat, or vice versa. Likewise, in our system of two electrons, measuring the spin of one electron does not necessarily make the other electron measure the same or the opposite spin - it merely changes the probability of the spin of the second electron.) Let the down state be \\(|0 \\rangle\\) and the up state be \\(|1 \\rangle\\). The full quantum spin state of an electron, \\(|\\psi_{1} \\rangle\\) can be expressed in the form below. \\[ \\begin{equation} |\\psi_{1} \\rangle=a_{1}|0 \\rangle+b_{1}|1 \\rangle \\end{equation} \\] The probability of the down state, given by the Born rule, is given by \\(|a_{1}|^2\\). Note that \\(a_{1}\\) can be a complex number. Now consider two electrons. \\[ \\begin{equation} |\\psi_{1} \\rangle=a_{1}|0 \\rangle+b_{1}|1 \\rangle \\\\ \\left. |\\psi_{2} \\right\\} = \\left. a_{2}|0 \\right\\} + \\left. b_{2}|1 \\right\\} \\end{equation} \\] The combined unentangled system, \\(|\\Psi \\rangle\\),is given by the so-called tensor product of the two individual systems. Without defining the tensor product, it works in the way that you would expect. In the below calculations, in the two-numbered states, the first number refers to the spin of the first electron, and the second number refers to the spin of the second electron. \\[ \\begin{equation} |\\Psi \\rangle = |\\psi_{1}\\rangle \\otimes |\\psi_{2}\\rangle \\\\ = (a_{1}|0 \\rangle+b_{1}|1 \\rangle) \\otimes (a_{2}|0 \\rangle+b_{2}|1 \\rangle) \\\\ = a_{1}a_{2}|00\\rangle + a_{1}b_{2}|10\\rangle + b_{1}a_{2}|01\\rangle + b_{1}b_{2}|11\\rangle \\end{equation} \\] This means that a two-electron system that is entangled to any degree cannot be of the form above, even if the probabilities, as given by the Born rule, add up to 1. Such systems can be physically produced in a laboratory. As an example, take the so-called singlet state below. \\[ \\begin{equation} |sing \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|10\\rangle - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|01\\rangle \\end{equation} \\] One can easily verify that there could be no unique values for \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}\\) that could produce the singlet state. Hence, we know that the singlet state must be entangled to some extent (in fact, it is maximally entangled). Susskind and Friedman (2015) also mention ways to calculate the degree of entanglement, but that is a bit more involved. 2.2 References Leonard Susskind, and Art Friedman.
